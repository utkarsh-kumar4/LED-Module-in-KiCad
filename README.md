<h1>💡 LED Module</h1>

<p>
This project is a simple LED module designed in <b>KiCad</b>. 
The design process included creating the schematic, drawing the PCB layout, 
and finally generating the 3D board view. The goal was to build a compact 
board that can power multiple LEDs individually with resistors and provide 
a ground reference through a connector.
</p>

<h2>📝 Project Steps</h2>
<p>
1. <b>Schematic Design:</b> Three LEDs (D1, D2, D3) were connected with their own resistors (R1, R2, R3) to limit current, all tied to a 4-pin connector.<br>
2. <b>PCB Layout:</b> The schematic was converted into a PCB design where resistors and LEDs were placed neatly, and tracks were routed for proper signal flow.<br>
3. <b>3D Board View:</b> A 3D model of the PCB was generated to visualize 
component placement and final board appearance.
